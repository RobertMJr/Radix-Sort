# Radix Sort Algorithm [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input. It performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.
 Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists.

### [Radix Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
* In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm.
* It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix.
* For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.
* Radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.
* Radix sort can be applied to data that can be sorted lexicographically, be they integers, words, punch cards, playing cards, or the mail.
